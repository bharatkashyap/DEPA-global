## Minutes

1. DEPA Globalisation has been picking up steam and we're now having conversations around the HOW of adoption

   1. Upcoming inter-ministerial meeting of the Data 6 is an opportunity to expand this collaboration
   2. The previous (and first) meeting happened in August, 2021
   3. The Bank of International Settlements is working on a paper on the opportunity of globalising DEPA in the financial domain
   4. The evolution of joint techno-legal standards is now the principal focus
   5. In this context, discussion with other (similar) implementations (Solid, MyData et al) is important

2. Sahamati and the AA ecosystem

   1. There is increasing adoption in the ecosystem; the adopters, volumes and consents fulfilled are steadily rising
   2. This data is adopter reported and there is a requirement for every adopter going forward to report this data back to Sahamati
   3. The certification process is being rapidly rolled out to ease the onboarding processes for new CMs, FIUs and FIPs

3. Success is not a guarantee
   1. UPI – despite its domestic success – could not be successfully internationalised
   2. There are lessons to be learned from previous failures at creating collectives
